## Community

GoAdmin project needs more developers to join together.

Now the project is maintained by [@cg33](https://github.com/chenhg5), who is a two years gopherã€‚

Work of the projects:

- [developing](https://github.com/GoAdminGroup/go-admin)
- forum project maintenance(not be a opensource project yet)
- [The maintenance of document improvement and translation](https://github.com/GoAdminGroup/docs)
- Publicity and community culture of the organization of the project

GoAdmin always adheres to an open and open attitude, and welcomes people with lofty and capable ability to join in the development of a conspiracy project and community. The community and the individual complement each other.

If you are optimistic about the development of GoAdmin and are willing to gamble for him, use time for future financial or reputational returns, and you have confidence in your own abilities, then you can try to fully read the GoAdmin code and understand GoAdmin's development plan, make your contribution to this. The pre-code flaws are large and can be modified. If you have the ability to make enough contributions, you will become the project's co-founder** or **core developer**. In the later stages, the code is highly sophisticated and there is still room for improvement. You can become a ** contributor by submitting a fix**. The team will remain open and accept new members. Every member of the team who works hard will also receive a certain return in the future based on the proportion of the effort to harvest the project.

If you don't have enough time and energy, but have a certain amount of money, and are equally optimistic about GoAdmin development, although GoAdmin has not yet planned a plan for this. But as long as you have enough interest, you can bring your plan to negotiate with us.

GoAdmin's capital revenue model is mainly:

- Accept donations
- Selling themes
- Selling plugins
- Provide saas customized development
- Commercial version for a fee

Revenue funds are mainly used to maintain the development of the community, and the return on compensation of developers, to promote the project to grow better.
